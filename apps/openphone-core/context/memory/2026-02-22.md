- User asked what else I can do. I explained my capabilities: decision support (cards), task automation (log_action), context tracking (update_user_context), long-term memory (update_memory), daily logging, email/calendar handling, reminders, and custom workflows. Emphasized that I only ask for input on ambiguous, high-stakes, or time-sensitive matters.

- User then asked if I could save our current conversation in memory. I confirmed and began logging this summary.

- Received notification: New email from someone@example.com with subject "Test subject". Created card for handling.

User ignored the test email from someone@example.com (subject: "Test subject").
